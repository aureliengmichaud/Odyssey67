 MX Alps Hybrid created by [ai03](https://github.com/ai03-2725). I have only included the MX_Only footprints used in the project. You can find more footprints from the repo [here](https://github.com/ai03-2725/MX_Alps_Hybrid).

 Elite-C created by [Keebio](https://github.com/keebio). I have only included the Elite-C footprint used in the project and the schematic symbol I've created. You can find more footprints from the repo [here](https://github.com/keebio/Keebio-Parts.pretty).

 Additionally, you can find these footprints and more on my [Keyboard Parts Library](https://github.com/aureliengmichaud/Keyboard-Parts-Library) repo.
